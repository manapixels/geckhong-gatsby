Who are the people building this platform? Why should I trust them? Selfi is designed with casualness in mind. No formal stuff. Just fun stuff and a place to throw ideas around and learn things about your personality. With that in mind, I want to make us \"vulnerable\", that we are a new company, that we are just average people, but we aim high and make self-discovery fun and useful.</p><p>Selfi is about being vulnerable. Being yourself, not adhering to norms and customs, doing things that you want to do. This vulnerability shows through in each team member's profile description. I specifically asked for less than 30% work-related descriptions and &gt; 70% casual things and hobbies that each team member like. <em>(the descriptions in the screenshot below is not ready yet though)</em></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-2.cloudinary.com/hdf0ugruv/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/Screenshot--157-.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure>","url":"https://manapixels.com/setting-the-tone/","canonical_url":null,"uuid":"8083aded-3426-4f40-a094-a04aba843689","page":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_styles":null,"comment_id":"5eb221501d5384001ef5d4bb","reading_time":3}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5eacdab3e194d2001e831513","title":"Selfi v0.01 - First official version of Selfi Personal","slug":"selfi-v0-01","featured":false,"feature_image":"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hdf0ugruv/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/Screenshot--31-.png","excerpt":"Yay~ It's been more than 10 months since we pushed a version to production.\nToday marks the renewal of versioning from v0.01, increasing by 0.01 with every\nsprint, each spanning 2 weeks.","custom_excerpt":null,"visibility":"public","created_at_pretty":"May 02, 2020","published_at_pretty":"April 29, 2020","updated_at_pretty":"June 02, 2020","created_at":"2020-05-02T10:28:03.000+08:00","published_at":"2020-04-29T10:27:00.000+08:00","updated_at":"2020-06-02T09:55:53.000+08:00","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"og_description":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyang L","slug":"zhenyang","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"website":null}],"primary_author":{"name":"Zhenyang L","slug":"zhenyang","bio":null,"profile_image":null,"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"website":null},"primary_tag":{"name":"Selfi","slug":"selfi","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"},"tags":[{"name":"Selfi","slug":"selfi","description":null,"feature_image":null,"meta_description":null,"meta_title":null,"visibility":"public"}],"plaintext":"Yay~ It's been more than 10 months since we pushed a version to production.\nToday marks the renewal of versioning from v0.01, increasing by 0.01 with every\nsprint, each spanning 2 weeks.","html":"<p>Yay~ It's been more than 10 months since we pushed a version to production.
